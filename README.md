# ATM-Simulation
A C-based ATM Simulation project with account management, transactions, and file handling.
This project is a C-based ATM Simulation System developed by Siva Prasad Reddy.
It simulates the core functionalities of an ATM, such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, money transfers, PIN management, and transaction history tracking.
Each account has its own transaction file where all activities are recorded with date and time.
The system also includes an admin module to view all accounts, reset user PINs, and manage account details.
This project helps understand:
1.File handling in C (fopen, fgets, fprintf, etc.)
2.Structures and arrays for managing accounts
3.String validation for account number, PIN, and names
4.Sorting and searching techniques
5.Real-time logging of transactions with time.h
It is designed for learning purposes and can be extended into a more advanced banking system with database support.
